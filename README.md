The Stock Biomancy folder has the original textures from the Create mod. I recomend this is where you
download textures for editing.
The Flesh and Bone folder is where we store all of the modified textures, and where you can see what
has already been modified. As of writing it is simply the folders of the origional Create mod textures, without any actual contents.
